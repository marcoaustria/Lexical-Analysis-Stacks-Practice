# Lexical-Analysis-Stacks-Practice
Project for COP3503 Programming Fundamentals 2

ASSIGNMENT: 
In this problem, you should implement thelexical  analysistask for a limited version(i.e., the depth of the nested loops) of a programming language. Lexical analysis is thefirst stage that compilers parse and detect the possible syntax errors.Ideally, any new (programming) languages can be designed and analyzed in the similarmanner.  You will need to analyze a Pascal-and-C-like language in this programmingassignment.Given a segment of the source code, your C++ code should analyze the code andextract all tokens.
Your C++ code should input a text file from user, which contains the expressionhe/she wants the compilers to analyze. Then, your code should parse the input, detectthe tokens, classify them, and print out the results.With this assignment, you will get practice with the stack implementation which isone of the most widely used data structures. Besides, you will be familiar with stringprocessing and input parsing, which are of crucial importance in most C++ projects.
